## 15. BINDING ARBITRATION

Subject to Section 17 below, in the event of a dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Service (“Dispute”), such dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION.  ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND PLATFORMEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.  All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.  All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com.  Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules.  Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.  If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside.  The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. 

## 16. CLASS ACTION WAIVER

You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

## 17. Equitable Relief

You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights or confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce these Terms of Service. We may, without waiving any other remedies under these Terms of Service, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of New York for purposes of any such action by us. 

## 18. MISCELLANEOUS  

These Terms of Service and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  Proceedings commenced by us to protect our intellectual property or confidential information shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of New York.

Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in these Terms of Service. 

No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.  

Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, these Terms of Service, together with our Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and us, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between you and us, with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import.  These Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.
