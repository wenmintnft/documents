WEN Token, LLC (“WEN Token,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) welcomes you. 

We provide WEN tokens (“Tokens”) subject to these WEN Tokens Issuance Terms and Conditions, which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you.  By accepting any Tokens from us, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these WEN Tokens Issuance Terms and Conditions and conditions of our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference (collectively, this “Agreement.”).  If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not accept any Tokens from us.  

## 1. NO PROFIT OR RETURN EXPECTED; NO ONE CURRENTLY INTENDS TO ASSIST IN PROVIDING A PROFIT OR RETURN


You hereby acknowledge, represent, covenant and agree that (i) you do not expect to profit or generate a return through your receipt and ownership of the Tokens and (ii) no one (including, without limitation, the Company, its affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and consultants) currently intends to exert any effort or provide any assistance in bringing about a profit or return for holders of the Tokens.  You understand, acknowledge and agree that you are virtually assured to lose all money used to purchase the Tokens. The terms of this paragraph are collectively referred to as the “Crucial Terms”.

You release (and agree and covenant not to sue) the Company for any breach of the Crucial Terms by you.

## 2. EQUITABLE RELIEF

You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of these WEN Tokens Issuance Terms and Conditions by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the courts in the state of Delaware for purposes of any such action by us.

## 3. MISCELLANEOUS  

These Terms of Service and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  Proceedings commenced by us to protect our intellectual property or confidential information shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware.

Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agrement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.  

The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import.  This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.
