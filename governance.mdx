    On-chain governance will happen via Tally.xyz. We'll make an announcement when the DAO goes live. Voting will happen on Polygon rather than Ethereum at first to reduce the gas cost of submitting proposals and voting.

    DAO communication will happen within Discord rather than Telegram. Discord makes it easier to manage serious discussions and multiple conversation flows. We'll make an announcement when the Discord goes live.
